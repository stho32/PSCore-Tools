# PSCore-Tools

A collection of tools, not especially sorted out. Just the things I need. 

GitHub-Pages / Documentation:

This library targets Powershell Core 6.

## Neat things you can do 

  - work with repositories of git and hg, get their state in ways that allow for automation
  - build docfx help from a powershell files automatically (the way I did it for this repo)
  - communicate with a scm server
